# Digits MNIST
This is a MATLAB program that identifies handwritten digits based
on (a subset of) the digits MNIST dataset.

It only uses mathematics to find results, so just matrix multiplication
and functions I wrote myself; i.e. it doesn't use any libraries to
perform forward prop, back prop, stochastic gradient, etc..

It is run from cover.m.
ANN1912705.m is a function that takes neural network related parameters
and trains the nerual network model accordingly.
